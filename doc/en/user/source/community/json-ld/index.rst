JSON-LD output format
=====================
This plugin brings in the ability to output features in JSON-LD format, using a look alike JSON-LD file as a template to operate a second level mapping over a stream of features. Both :ref:`simple features <data_vector>` and :ref:`complex features <app-schema.complex-features>` are supported. 

`JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org>`_ is a Linked Data format, based on JSON format, and revolves around the concept of context to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model.
